## Features

- Create interactive mini apps using AI
- Browse and return to your previous creations
- Auto-save your work securely
- See your app changes in real-time

## Quick Start

1. [Try the demo](https://vibes.diy/) - No setup required!
2. Or set up your own:
   - Clone the repository
   - Install with `pnpm i`
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your AI account key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)
   - Run `pnpm dev`

## Developer previews on the main domain (no redirects)

Opt into an experimental branch deploy on the primary site using Netlify Split Testing with a cookie. Use `?ab=<branch>` on the main domain, for example:

```
https://vibes.diy/?ab=feature-new-ui
```

Note: the underlying Netlify cookie is named `nf_ab` and is host‑scoped by default (not shared between `www` and apex). See [docs/split-testing.md](docs/split-testing.md) for details and scope options.

## Your Work is Always Safe

Every app you create is automatically saved, so you can:

- Browse your creations in the sidebar
- Return to previous work anytime
- Keep track of your building history
- Save screenshots of your apps
